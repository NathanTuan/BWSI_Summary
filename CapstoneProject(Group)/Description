A group project with my 3 other teammates. We trained a zero shot object detection model to detect and label brain tumors from MRI scans. 
I used a YOLO v11 model to create ground truth boxes, thereby creating artificial datasets from classification ones, and I also
generated artificial medical reports to relate image and text descriptions for the zero shot training.
